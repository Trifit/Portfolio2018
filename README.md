# David H.Parramon's personal portfolio

## The objective:
The main objective, of course was to create a new version for my personal portfolio but I always belived your own portfolio should be state of art, ultimate it shows your habilities creating websites. Despite being a bit overkill, I decided to use React to create the next version of my Portfolio, mainly for two reasons:
1. As a showcase of my hability with React.
2. React, being a component ui based framework is becoming one of the most popular frameworks in the market..
